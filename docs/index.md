# Welcome to NUS CG3207 - Computer Architecture

Welcome to CG3207! In this repository, you will find the manuals for each of the 4 lab exercises you will complete for this course, as well as instructions on how to set up the tools you'll need.

Labs for this course are generally free and easy. Physical attendance is recommended, but not necessary **EXCEPT FOR ASSESSMENTS**. There are 4 lab assignments in total, each of which will first be introduced in a briefing, and then assessed in a subsequent (not necessarily the next) week. At least one member of the teaching team will always be present in the lab during lab sessions to assist with any doubts you have.

Check [NUSMods](https://nusmods.com/courses/CG3207/computer-architecture) for the lab venue corresponding to your lab slot. 

## Intended learning outcomes (labs)

In the lab component of this course, you will put into practice the concepts learned in lecture (as well as some you explore on your own), and see them come to life.

You will learn:

* The RISC-V architecture and assembly language.
* How to build your very own CPU which can execute real RISC-V programs.
* Advanced CPU design tricks to improve performance.

## First steps

To make the most of the labs, we recommend doing some reading before you come for your first session.

1. First, the page on [how to use this website](getting_started/howto.md). Pay special attention to the section on "How to get help", as it is very important.

2. Next, the [prerequisites for the lab](getting_started/prereq.md). If you have any concerns with these prerequisites, please approach the teaching team as early as possible. The background knowledge outlined in this page is critical for you to do well in this course.

3. Make sure you read [Getting to know your Nexys 4](getting_started/nexys4.md) and [install Vivado](getting_started/vivado_install_guide.md) on your personal computer as soon as possible. If you do not have access to a Windows or Linux (preferred) PC, you should try your best to get/borrow one for this course. Vivado does work in Parallels Desktop on a Mac, but this is an expensive piece of software, and not entirely a supported configuration.

4. Finally, choose an architecture that you want to work with for the labs. You may choose between RISC-V (recommended), or ARM (deprecated, not well-supported by teaching team). This might also be a good time to form teams of two to three people for labs 2, 3, and 4. Note that Lab 1 will be an individual exercise, and you will not be assessed as a team - though, of course, we encourage you to work together (academically honestly, of course - no copying or direct sharing of work, please).
